## Personal Notes

This board was originally installed in a 16MHz 386SX system that I had at home in junior high, circa 1991. Before I left for college in 1997, I cobbled together a working system from spare parts including this board, then forgot about it for 20 years until I found it in my parents' storage and took it home. The board sat unused in my collection until 2025, when I installed it in my newly acquired Zenith Z-248 system. I find the colorful animated Oak Technology banner very nostalgic, since I watched it many times on one of my earliest computers.
