# Gateway Pentium III 933MHz with GeForce3

![Case Front](case-front.jpeg)

## Backstory

After I built my K6-2 with Voodoo3 in 2024, I downloaded a bunch of Glide games from GOG.com, only to realize that the K6 wasn't *quite* up to the task of playing some of them, so I bought this system to play them on. After college I went straight from the K6 to a Pentium 4, so this is my first Pentium III system.
