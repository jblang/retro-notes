# Juniper Valley AMD K6-2 550MHz with Voodoo3

![Photo BIOS Screen](front-bios.jpeg)

## Backstory

In college around 1998, I had a very similar system with a Voodoo3 and K6 Processor.  To the best of my recollection, the K6 was 300MHz and Voodoo3 was a 2000.  The sound was a Sound Blaster AWE32 that I had transplanted from a 486 and a Pentium before this. 

In 2024, I attempted to rebuild the system as closely as possible, with a few upgrades:
- Bought a Juniper Valley K6-2 350MHz desktop on eBay
- Hammered out the dents and spray painted the badly dented and scuffed case.
- Replaced the noisy Socket 7 CPU cooler with a new StarTech one
- Upgraded the Trident 3DImage 9850 with an AGP Voodoo3 3000 and added a cooling fan
- Upgraded the CPU from a K6-2 350MHz to a K6-2 533MHz and overclocked to 550MHz
- Upgraded RAM from 64GB to 128GB PC100 SDRAM
- Added a Sound Blaster 32 PnP CT3600 
- Added a CF to IDE adapter with a 32GB CF card (the largest disk supported by the BIOS)
- Added a 2 port USB bracket to connect to the header on the motherboard
- Kept the motherboard, NIC, floppy drive, and CD-RW as is.
- Installed Windows 98SE
