## Backstory

This system is an amalgamation of parts from many different sources, including several computers I had in junior high and high school. Eventually after transplanting the best parts to my new AMD K6 system in college, I cobbled together a working system out of spare parts from the previous systems:

- From the Pentium:
    - Case and PSU
    - BioStar motherboard
    - 120MHz Pentium CPU
- From the 486:
    - 8MB RAM
    - 320MB HDD
    - 2X CD-ROM drive
- From the 386
    - ISA VGA card
    - Keyboard

This system stayed in my parents' storage for many years until I came across it in 2018 and brought it home. Unfortunately, I damaged the traces on the original motherboard while trying to replace the dead RTC without a suitable desoldering iron. After that, I decided to rebuild a system as close as practical to the original and bought the following components:

- Micropolis motherboard:
    - On-board sound based on a Creative Labs Vibra chip.
      - Proprietary sound riser card was missing
      - I used a multimeter to trace the output from the stereo amplifier to the header pins
      - Built a custom 3.5mm adapter bracket.
    - On-board PS/2 mouse
- 32MB of EDO RAM
- Stealth 64 video card
- A rear-bracket CF to IDE adapter

Later, I got the following additional components from Computer Reset and further upgraded the system:

- Yamaha Audician OPL3-SAx Sound Card
- 8X Mitsumi CD-ROM Drive
- PCI 10/100 ethernet card
- HIS [S3 Virge DX](https://vintage3d.org/virgedx.php) video card with 2MB DRAM, upgradeable to 4MB
